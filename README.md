# Urban sound classification using Deep Learning

## Dataset
- The [UrbanSound8k]( https://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/) dataset contains 8732 labeled sound excerpts (<=4s) of urban sounds from 10 classes: air_conditioner, car_horn, children_playing, dog_bark, drilling, enginge_idling, gun_shot, jackhammer, siren, and street_music. The classes are drawn from the urban sound taxonomy.All excerpts are taken from field recordings uploaded to www.freesound.org.
8732 audio files of urban sounds (see description above) in WAV format. The sampling rate, bit depth, and number of channels are the same as those of the original file uploaded to Freesound (and hence may vary from file to file).

## Librosa
- Librosa was used for data preprocessing and feature extraction.
